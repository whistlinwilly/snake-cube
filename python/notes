### Approach
-Start with possible representations of snake, cube, etc.
-How many possible starting positions are there?

### Thoughts
Seems eerily related to palindromes? The block form at least is made of three distinct palindromes
which could be a useful pruning heuristic?

This isn't true, look at snake example #2

What about solving a 3x3 cube in a 4x4 space?

### Side Questions
Transform between representations?
Snake example #2 was taken from an online example, but produces a different, seemingly correct solution. Do puzzles have more than one unique solution?
